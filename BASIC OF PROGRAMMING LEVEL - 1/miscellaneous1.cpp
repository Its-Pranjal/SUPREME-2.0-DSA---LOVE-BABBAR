/*

The output of this code is 10Pranjal

POint 1 . The "<<" priority is high than the conditional operator i.e. if condition, so "<<" execute first than if condition
POint 2 . Here the code is using this "<<" operator, which returns stream of object
Point 3. Now here the if condition check that the cout<<n execution
    ðŸ‘‰if cout<<n executed successfully than it return true , so if block is executed
    ðŸ‘‰if cout<<n dont not executed than it return false , so if block is not executed
    ðŸ‘‰so here the cout<<"n" executed successfully, so it return true so if block get executed
