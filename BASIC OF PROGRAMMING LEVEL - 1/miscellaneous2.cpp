/*

The output of this code is Pranjal

POint 1 . The ">>" priority is high then the conditional operator i.e. if condition, so ">>" execute first then if condition
POint 2 . Here the code is using this ">>" operator, which returns stream of object
Point 3. Now here the if condition check that the cin>>n execution
    ðŸ‘‰if cin>>n executed successfully then it return true , so if block is executed
    ðŸ‘‰if cin>>n dont not executed then it return false , so if block is not executed
    ðŸ‘‰so here the cin>>"n" executed successfully, so it return true so if block get executed
