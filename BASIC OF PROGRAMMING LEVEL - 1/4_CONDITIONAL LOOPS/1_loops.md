# Loops in C++

## What are Loops?

In C++, loops are control structures that enable the repetitive execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met. They provide a powerful way to handle tasks that involve repetition.

## Importance of Loops

Loops are essential in programming for the following reasons:

- **Efficiency:** They allow the execution of repetitive tasks without duplicating code.
- **Automation:** Loops automate processes, reducing manual intervention.
- **Flexibility:** Code can dynamically adapt based on changing conditions.
- **Readability:** Well-structured loops enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Types of Loops in C++

### 1. **For Loop**

The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence for a specific number of times.

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. **While Loop**

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    while (count < 5) {
        std::cout << count << std::endl;
        ++count;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. **Do-While Loop**

The `do-while` loop executes a block of code at least once and then repeatedly executes it as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    do {
        std::cout << count << std::endl;
        ++count;
    } while (count < 5);
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Loops are fundamental in C++ programming, offering efficient ways to handle repetitive tasks. Depending on the specific requirements, whether iterating through a range, checking a condition, or handling collections, C++ provides versatile loop constructs.
